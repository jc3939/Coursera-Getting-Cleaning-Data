This file tells you how run_analysis.R works.

1. You may need to put run_analysis.R and Samsung data (rename it as UCI_Dataset) in the same folder and set this folder as your working directory.

2. run the “run_analysis.R” script and you will have a clean tidy dataset named “aggregateByActivitySub” in the working directory with 180 rows and 68 columns which tells you the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
